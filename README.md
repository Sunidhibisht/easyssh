upload or download files from remote host and execute commands

There are times when you need to upload a file or execute a command on a server that is behind firewall. 

You need to first connect to the gateway server and only then you can access the server within the network.

This script will allow you to connect to any server using web interface. You do not need putty or FTP client.
